# The template for a professional Python Package

In October 2022 I wrote [this Medium article](https://medium.com/@tomergabay/9f66538ebc2) in which I explain step-by-step on how to create a professional Python Package. To make it extra easy for everyone I've also created [this](https://github.com/sTomerG/my-package) repository which can be used as a template. Still, to fully understand all components of this repository I strongly recommend reading the [article](https://medium.com/@tomergabay/9f66538ebc2).

## Contents

- A *src/* folder with example code.
- A *pyproject.toml* with all the necessary dependencies specified.
- A *tests/* folder with example tests, using pytest and Hypothesis.
- Pre-commit hooks for *Black*, isort and flake8.
- A workflow [*test-package.yaml*](.github/workflows/test-package.yaml) which automates testing with Github Actions for different Python versions (optionally) on different Operating Systems, using caching to speed up the process.
- A *docs/* folder with a Sphinx project template for ReadTheDocs which can easily be auto-generated with one command, including automatic API documentation of all code in *src/*.

## Usage

To convert this package template to your own package please take the following steps:

1. Clone this repository: `git clone https://github.com/sTomerG/my-package.git`

2. Create a virtual environment using pyenv and pyenv-virtualenv or `python3 -m venv venv`

3. Activate the virtual environment using using pyenv or `source venv/bin/activate`

4. Upgrade pip and install poetry: `pip install --upgrade pip && pip install poetry`

5. Activate the poetry venv with `poetry shell` if you're using pyenv.
   
6. Change some fields of `[tool.poetry]` in [*pyproject.toml*](pyproject.toml), e.g. the project name, in field `name` and `packages`

7. Change the name of the *my_package/* folder in *src/* to the new name of your package (use underscores instead of hyphens here).

8. Change the top fields in [*docs/source/conf.py*](docs/source/conf.py), e.g. `project` to the same value as `name` in *pyproject.toml*. 

9. Reinstall the package with `poetry install`

10.  Change the `my_package` part in  `from my_package.calc import` to the name of the folder you chose in step 6 in [*tests/test_calc/test_square.py*](tests/test_calc/test_square.py) and in [*docs/source/notebooks/usage.ipynb*](docs/source/notebooks/usage.ipynb).

11. Check if the tests are still running correctly with working with `poetry run pytest` 

12. Rebuild the docs with `poetry run sphinx-autobuild docs/source docs/build/html`

13. Edit in the top of the README and *docs/source/index.md* the links

## Note

When you add dependencies with `poetry add`, make sure to also run `poetry export --with doc -f requirements.txt --output docs/rtd_requirements.txt` to update the requirements file for the ReadTheDocs.
